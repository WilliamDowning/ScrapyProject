But that doesn’t mean they’ll act on them.</p><p class="story-text" data-index="4">“You’re going to find a great consistency between our rules and the rules that were adopted in years past, which I think most people continue to view as fair,” <a href="https://legislativenavigator.ajc.com/#members/852" target="_blank">Senate Redistricting Chairman John Kennedy</a>, a Republican from Macon, said after the last public hearing Wednesday in Martinez, near Augusta. “We’ve been given some very useful information specific to the districts or geographic areas where people have come and spoken to us.”</p><p class="story-text" data-index="6">A repeat of the process from 2011 is what many people told lawmakers they’re afraid of.</p><p class="story-text" data-index="9">“I worry these hearings will be nothing,” Marijke Kylstra of the advocacy group Fair Count said at the Martinez meeting. “If people can’t comment on the maps once they’re drawn, and there’s no clear way for complaints to be responded to and remedied, then these hearings will have been revealed as an empty gesture.”</p><p class="story-text" data-index="10">Georgia’s mapmakers haven’t yet committed to any rules or guidelines. It’s also unknown when they plan to meet at the Capitol for a special redistricting session, which could occur anytime between September and the end of the year.</p><p class="story-text" data-index="11">Ten years ago, House and Senate <a href="https://www.senate.ga.gov/committees/Documents/2011EX1Minutes140.pdf" target="_blank">redistricting committees adopted guidelines</a> for their work: among them, hearings would be open to the public, and lawmakers would avoid dividing communities along political lines.</p><p class="story-text" data-index="12">But the results didn’t always reflect those goals.</p><p class="story-text" data-index="13">Lawmakers crafted maps behind closed doors before their public release, and many Democratic-leaning metro areas were split into multiple legislative districts, with lines drawn in a way that gave the state’s Republican majority an advantage.</p><p class="story-text" data-index="14">Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University, said while lawmakers pay attention to <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-lawmakers-start-redistricting-process-before-making-maps/7LNGONHKFZGC5LTU5GXJVBTGBM/" target="_blank">comments made at the public hearings</a>, it remains to be seen whether they will take any of the comments into consideration. One thing that rarely changes is that Republicans vote with Republicans, and Democrats do the same.</p><p class="story-text" data-index="15">“It’s purely a party-line vote every time, no matter what party is involved,” he said. “Each party is going to try as hard as they can to benefit their candidates, and that’s mission No. 1.”</p><p class="story-text" data-index="16">In the election after the last redistricting process, Republicans gained one U.S. House seat, six state House seats and two state Senate seats.</p><p class="story-text" data-index="17">Legislators are required to set new political boundaries so that each district represents roughly the same number of people, accounting for Georgia’s 1 million <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/2020-census-georgias-minority-populations-have-surged/SLZIWRHNE5CMDJR2EDMRD42ZDY/" target="_blank">population increase</a> since 2010. Most of the growth occurred in metropolitan areas.</p><p class="story-text" data-index="18">The state’s increasing diversity, with the white population shrinking to 50%, will pose a challenge for Republican lawmakers trying to create favorable districts. They must comply with the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racially discriminatory maps that dilute the voting strength of Black voters.</p><p class="story-text" data-index="19">But the courts have upheld allowing politicians to draw lines for partisan gain as long as they don’t explicitly reduce the strength of nonwhite voters based on race. And for the first redistricting year since a 2013 Supreme Court ruling, maps in Georgia and other states with histories of discrimination don’t need to be submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice for approval.</p><p class="story-text" data-index="20"></p><p class="story-text" data-index="21"></p><p class="c-connext hyperlocal_promo b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"></p><p class="c-connext eos-msg__nolog-or-nosub b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"></p><hr class="divider"/><h1 class="h1-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><b>Redistricting in Georgia</b></h1><p class="story-text" data-index="26"><b>What happened:</b> State legislators heard from the public during 11 public meetings across Georgia before they start redrawing the state’s political maps.</p><p class="story-text" data-index="27"><b>The latest: </b>U.S. census numbers released Thursday showed substantial population growth in suburban areas, and the state’s population became increasingly diverse over the past decade.</p><p class="story-text" data-index="28"><b>What’s next:</b> The Georgia General Assembly will begin drawing new political maps and then hold a special session to approve them sometime this fall.</p><section class="borders b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"><span class="prefix">Explore</span><a class="link" href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/redistricting-in-georgia-what-is-it-and-how-will-it-affect-you/4RUQUGAFFBH2PGCZ3KAQGC7KZM/" target="_self">Redistricting in Georgia: What is it and how will it affect you?</a></section></div></div><div class="c-section full-width b-clear-both"><div class="c-blogAuthor b-margin-bottom-30 multiple-authors"><p class="blogAuthor-title">About the Author<!-- -->s</p><div class="blog-author-content"><div class="b-flexRow blog-author-content-heading has-image"><a href="/staff/mark-niesse/" rel="author"><div class="content-profileImage"><div class="c-image-component    image-landscape"><div class="image-component-image  "><div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"><div class="lazyload-wrapper "><img src="/pf/resources/logos/AJC/placeholder.jpg?d=647" style="width:100%" data-placeholder="true" data-src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/zR-p7zxjS-4gaHIOafyCgOK9Luk=/100x100/s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/280438f9-0013-488b-bcfe-2b5be03376bb.png" alt="ajc.com" class="placeholder-image  "/></div><p class="photo-credit-text"></p></div></div></div></div></a><div class="content-authorName"><a href="/staff/mark-niesse/" rel="author">Mark Niesse</a><div class="content-authorSocial"><a href="https://twitter.com/markniesse"><img src="/pf/resources/images/twitter-burger.svg?d=647" alt="Follow Mark Niesse on twitter" width="17" height="17"/></a></div></div></div></div><div class="blog-author-content"><div class="b-flexRow blog-author-content-heading has-image"><a href="/staff/maya-t-prabhu/" rel="author"><div class="content-profileImage"><div class="c-image-component    image-landscape"><div class="image-component-image  "><div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"><div class="lazyload-wrapper "><img src="/pf/resources/logos/AJC/placeholder.jpg?d=647" style="width:100%" data-placeholder="true" data-src="https://www.ajc.com/resizer/n-vJdsGSH2sDoHCkU7X0ITGMfP4=/100x100/s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/78d26dd2-7e21-41fc-8abf-2bfa9c91db71.png" alt="ajc.com" class="placeholder-image  "/></div><p class="photo-credit-text"></p></div></div></div></div></a><div class="content-authorName"><a href="/staff/maya-t-prabhu/" rel="author">Maya T.

Atlanta police and sanitation crews finished removing protesters and their belongings from outside the Wendy’s on Monday July 6, 2020 where Rayshard Brooks was shot and killed by an officer last month. The last concrete barricade was put in place around noon. Some of the protesters milled nearby while a worker from the BP gas station next door pulled boards off the windows. Monday’s cleanup followed a violent holiday weekend that started Saturday night when 8-year-old Secoriea Turner was fatally shot while sitting in a car near the restaurant. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms denounced the violence in an emotional press conference at police headquarters in which she and Turner’s family urged people to come forward with information about the girl’s killers. About 9:30 a.m. Monday, uniformed officers and multiple workers in neon attire tossed flowers and other items from a makeshift memorial outside the Wendy’s into garbage bags. The site has served as ground zero for protests since Brooks was shot in the parking lot following an attempted DUI arrest in the drive-thru line June 12. The restaurant was destroyed during a large protest the next day. Three people have been arrested on arson charges in connection with the incident.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have a delightfully adorable English bulldog named Goo Goo and a equally adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ajcrodneyho","custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[{"name":"Oyster Bay High School, 1987"},{"name":"Princeton University, B.A., political economics, 1991"},{"name":"George State University Robinson School, MBA marketig, 2007"}],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2021-03-30T12:51:24.297Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/3701b49c-0a45-4a95-a5c8-7d7a96ec061f.png","expertise":"2, Film, TV, radio, comedy, things to do around town, business","beat":"Entertatinment","author_type":"Staff","type":"author","bio_page":"/staff/rodney-ho/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/rodneyhoajc/"}}}]},"description":{"basic":"In her new podcast \"Davi the Scapegoat,\" Davi Crimmins opens up for the first time about getting fired from the Bert Show in June."},"display_date":"2022-08-25T13:10:26.111Z","headlines":{"basic":"Davi Crimmins says she refused severance so she could speak openly about Bert Show firing","meta_title":"Davi Crimmins talks Bert Show firing on podcast","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":"Davi Crimmins talks Bert Show firing on podcast"},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"IWSNIUHNA5CDHISNBT65EJAHQI","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/360Ag7dYf_2iYZYFRxRrUmoI1W8=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/IWSNIUHNA5CDHISNBT65EJAHQI.JPG","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","keywords":[],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"Davi Crimmins 2022 update 1.JPG","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/IWSNIUHNA5CDHISNBT65EJAHQI.JPG","owner":"rodney.ho@ajc.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/360Ag7dYf_2iYZYFRxRrUmoI1W8=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/IWSNIUHNA5CDHISNBT65EJAHQI.JPG","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/360Ag7dYf_2iYZYFRxRrUmoI1W8=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/IWSNIUHNA5CDHISNBT65EJAHQI.JPG","restricted":false,"takenOn":"2022-08-16T09:27:11Z","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/yWr4v60E0TBTkKEKFAjK8V0clLo=/300x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/IWSNIUHNA5CDHISNBT65EJAHQI.JPG","version":2,"template_id":594},"address":{},"caption":"Davi Crimmins has started a new podcast \"Scape G.O.A.T.\" two months after getting fired from the Bert Show syndicated radio show.

I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.
