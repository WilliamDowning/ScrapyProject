                  <h3>Dr. Brian Moore, Chair for the Department of Construction Management<a id="moore"></a></h3>
                  
                  <p><img class="medium img_left" id="" src="/constructionmanagement/images/brian-moore.jpg" alt="Dr. Brian Moore">It is my pleasure to introduce Dr. Brian Moore as the next Chair for the Department
                     of Construction Management. Dr. Moore will begin serving in this role effective July
                     1, 2022.</p>
                  
                  <p>Dr. Brian Moore was employed as a Section Chief/Manager with the California Department
                     of Water Resources (DWR) and led DWR’s Oroville Construction Office from 2018 to 2022.&nbsp;
                     In 2017, Dr. Moore became a licensed Civil Engineer in the State of California.&nbsp; In
                     addition to managing construction projects in Northern California for DWR, Dr. Moore
                     also served as a Construction Management Supervisor for DWR in Southern California
                     from 2012 to 2017.&nbsp; His work with DWR has included such projects as bridge seismic
                     upgrades, aqueduct emergency repairs, emergency pipeline repairs, emergency spillway
                     repairs at the Oroville Dam (i.e., the tallest dam in North America), LEED Certified
                     building construction, paving projects, radial gate repairs, and many other projects
                     associated with California’s State Water Project. &nbsp;Prior to joining DWR, Dr. Moore
                     worked as a consultant for Vali Cooper &amp; Associates in DWR’s Southern California office
                     from 2012 to 2013.&nbsp;</p>
                  
                  <p>Before working as a consultant for Vali Cooper &amp; Associates, Dr. Moore spent thirteen
                     years in Georgia higher education, serving from 2007 to 2012 as a department chair
                     and tenured full professor for the Department of Construction Management and Civil
                     Engineering at Georgia Southern University.&nbsp;</p>
                  
                  <p>From 1999 to 2007, Dr. Moore taught graduate and undergraduate construction management
                     courses at Southern Polytechnic State University and served as the coordinator for
                     the Construction Management graduate program. &nbsp;As a member of the Construction Management
                     Association of America (CMAA), he served CMAA’s South Atlantic Chapter from 2001 to
                     2007 in various chapter officer positions including secretary/treasurer, vice-president,
                     president, and senior advisory board member. &nbsp;From 2009 to 2015, Dr. Moore was a member
                     of CMAA’s National Foundation Board of Directors.</p>
                  
                  <p>Dr. Moore also served from 2014-2015 as President of the Associated Schools of Construction
                     (ASC).&nbsp; In 2010, Dr. Moore concluded more than four years as editor of ASC’s <em>International Journal of Construction Education and Research</em>, a peer-reviewed scholarly journal. &nbsp;He also served as ASC’s Region 2 Director (i.e.,
                     Southeastern U.S.) from 2004 through 2006 and was awarded ASC’s Outstanding Educator
                     Award in 2007.</p>
                  
                  <p>Dr. Moore has a proven track record of successful management, engineering, teaching,
                     and scholarship. &nbsp;Prior to his role in academia, he worked for Cordell W. Ingram and
                     Parsons Brinkerhoff on teams managing large-scale construction projects at airports
                     in Georgia and California, respectively. &nbsp;He has also worked as a construction site
                     manager/superintendent and as a resident engineer/inspector in Atlanta.&nbsp; His early
                     career included working at Kennedy Space Center as an engineer with McDonnell Douglas
                     Astronautics Corporation.</p>
                  
                  <p>Dr. Moore earned his Ph.D. in Civil Engineering and an M.S. degree, specializing in
                     Construction Management, at Georgia Institute of Technology. His graduate work included

                           <p><strong>September 20, 2019</strong></p>
                           
                           <p>In its most successful fundraiser yet, Kennesaw State University’s Department of Construction
                              Management raised more than $170,000 for scholarships and the development of state-of-the-art
                              teaching facilities. The 18th Annual Industry Advisory Board Fundraiser Gala, held
                              at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre September 19, 2019, drew more than 80 sponsorships
                              from individuals and organizations.</p>
                           
                           <p>Funds raised this year eclipsed the previous high of $167,000 set in 2018. During
                              the event, construction management students were awarded $19,000 in scholarships.
                              The scholarships presented on the occasion included six Industry Advisory Board Scholarships,
                              two endowed Davidson Family Scholarships, Carl Frinzi Scholarship, and Atlanta Electrical
                              Contractors Scholarship.&nbsp; Three new annual scholarships were raised during the event
                              namely Beth Lowry Scholarship, Paul Hogan Scholarship, and Chamberlain Hrdlicka White

                           <p>“We are indebted to our Industry Advisory Board Members who continue to support out
                              program through their intellectual and monetary contributions”. said Khalid Siddiqi,
                              Interim Dean of Kennesaw State’s Department of Construction Management. “Through the
                              generosity of our donors we are able to offer scholarships to our students who wish
                              to receive a world-class construction education at KSU. I am delighted to see the
                              growth of the fundraiser revenues every year.”&nbsp; The Construction Industry Advisory
                              Board has 45 members from different sectors of the Construction Industry, and we attribute
                              the success of the fundraiser in part to the department’s robust industry advisory
                              board, Siddiqi said.&nbsp; The board and their members – many of whom are donors – and
                              its mission is to ensure students meet the educational and career needs of the industry
                              from an employer’s perspective.</p>
                           
                           <p>Guest Speakers on the occasion included Mike Kenefsky developer of EHS Software and
                              Robert Coffey a leader in construction data, software, and services who transformed
                              construction procurement across the US and Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Kat Schwaig, Provost, Kennesaw
                              State University spoke on the occasion and shared the growth and community impact
                              of KSU in the region.&nbsp; Dr. Schwaig also acknowledged the contributions of the Construction
                              Industry Advisory Board towards enhancing the quality of the program and for the scholarships
                              they raise for the students. Board members were presented with awards in recognition
                              of their individual performance towards the board mission.</p>

                              Advisory Board Scholarship said “I wanted to reach out to you and thank you again
                              for welcoming us to last night’s Construction Management event.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your hospitality
                              made a definite impression.&nbsp; I appreciate all of the hard work that went into planning
                              and hosting the dinner and fundraiser.&nbsp; It was an excellent opportunity for students
                              to network and for stakeholders to meet faculty and staff members.&nbsp; More importantly,
                              it was a guided lesson for the students who will be tomorrow's business leaders.&nbsp;
                              Hopefully the students enjoyed the evening, appreciated the recognition, and recognize
                              the importance of giving back and supporting emerging leadership.&nbsp; Prior to this event,
                              I had no true connection with KSU.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks to you and your staff, I can now say that
                              I am a proud KSU Owl Parent.“</p>

                              Management raised more than $167,000 for scholarships and the development of state-of-the-art
                              teaching facilities.</p>

                              Energy Performing Arts Centre, drew more than 72 sponsorships from individuals and
                              organizations.<br>Funds raised this year eclipsed the previous high of $140,000 set in 2017. During
                              the event, construction management students were awarded $14,500 in scholarships.</p>
                           
                           <p>“We are so very grateful to see this level of support from our industry partners throughout
                              the region,” said Khalid Siddiqi, chair of Kennesaw State’s Department of Construction
                              Management. “Through their generosity, we are able to lessen the financial burden
                              of students who wish to receive a world-class education at KSU. I am thrilled to see
                              how much this event has grown since its inception.”</p>
                           
                           <p>The gala started from humble beginnings, raising just $7,000 in its first year. Its
                              recent success can be attributed in part to the department’s robust industry advisory
                              board, Siddiqi said.<br>The board has 42 members – many of whom are donors – and its mission is to ensure
                              students meet the educational and career needs of the industry from an employer’s
                              perspective.</p>

                              where I am.”</p>
                           
                           <p>The Reza Abree Endowed Scholarship provides financial support to an undergraduate
                              student majoring in construction management, civil engineering, construction engineering
                              or environmental engineering, with preference given to those studying civil engineering.
                              Abree established the scholarship with a gift of $25,000 that was matched by the former
                              Southern Polytechnic Foundation of KSU, making the total commitment $50,000.</p>
                           
                           <p>Additionally, Abree gave $20,000 to benefit the University’s future construction management
                              building, with the intent of naming a faculty office within the new structure.</p>
                           
                           <p>To be eligible for the scholarship, the KSU student must also be an undergraduate
                              enrolled full time with a minimum grade-point average of 3.0.</p>
                           
                           <p>After working at various construction companies around metropolitan Atlanta, Abree
                              founded United Consulting in 1990 and serves as chief executive officer. Abree, a
                              registered professional engineer in Georgia, has built Norcross-based United Consulting
                              into one of the top engineering firms in the area. He earned his Bachelor of Science
                              in civil engineering technology in Marietta, Georgia, at what was then called Southern
                              Technical Institute.</p>
                           
                           <p>“The scholarship gift of Reza Abree will enable KSU students to overcome their financial
                              difficulty and complete their studies faster,” said Dr. Khalid Siddiqi, interim dean
                              of the College of Architecture and Construction Management at Kennesaw State. “It
                              is alums like Reza who give back to their institution to create another success story,
                              and this is one way of creating their own legacy. I have known Reza for some time
                              and I am greatly impressed by his involvement in community development activities.</p>
                           
                           <p>“Reza has a great story to tell because he started from scratch and has been able
                              to create a successful consulting firm which specializes in geotechnical engineering
                              and his operations spread all over the southeastern United States. We appreciate the
                              scholarship endowment created by Reza to benefit KSU students.”</p>
                           
                           <p>On April 19, 2019, Abree was on Kennesaw State’s Marietta campus for a scholarship
                              signing ceremony and luncheon. After lunch, he toured the Southern Polytechnic College
                              of Engineering and Engineering Technology, along with the Department of Construction

                              shooters who participated. A team of four CM students, led by Hank Stricland (KSU
                              AGC Student Chapter President), also participated in the event. The awards were presented
                              to the winners by Mr. Paul Hogan, Past Chair of the Construction Industry Advisory
                              Board, KSU Football Coach Brian Bohannon and Dr. Khalid Siddiqi.</p>

                           <p><em>Construction management student, organization earn national honors</em></p>
                           
                           <p>April 29, 2019</p>
                           
                           <p>Mac Calhoun came to Kennesaw State University without knowing which major to pursue
                              or what career path to follow after graduation.</p>
                           
                           <p>That all changed when he took an aptitude test during a freshman seminar course which
                              introduced him to the University’s&nbsp;construction management degree program, convincing
                              him that he could have a future in homebuilding.</p>
                           
                           <p>“It was a program that was growing tremendously and had deep industry connections,
                              so it seemed like a natural fit,” said Calhoun, who recently received the Outstanding
                              Student Award from the <a href="https://www.nahb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Association of Home Builders&nbsp;(NAHB)</a>. The prestigious award recognizes student members of NAHB based on their academic
                              standing, involvement with their student chapter and interest in pursuing residential
                              building.</p>
                           
                           <p>With Calhoun at the helm, the KSU chapter has seen membership grow exponentially in
                              its five-year history, leading the organization to receive NAHB’s Outstanding Student
                              Chapter of the Year Award for going the “extra mile” in engaging with local home builders,
                              the community and the student body.</p>
                           
                           <p>“It’s really special to receive that kind of recognition,” said Calhoun, who works
                              part-time for David Weekly Homes while finishing his degree. “We have a lot of good
                              industry professionals we connect with and a great core of students who are really
                              interested in the industry, and the award validates the kind of work we put in to
                              better ourselves.”</p>
                           
                           <p>For the last three years, Calhoun has also represented KSU’s&nbsp;Department of Construction
                              Management&nbsp;in NAHB’s annual student competition, designed to give students the opportunity
                              to apply their newly acquired skills on a real-life management project. As a team,
                              the students submit and defend development proposals to a group of construction executives
                              who act as judges.</p>
                           
                           <p>KSU’s team submitted a 100-page proposal detailing a worksite development and marking
                              plans similar to that of a professional builder. Out of 37 universities competing
                              this year, Kennesaw State placed fifth. The student chapter won the three-day competition
                              in 2017.</p>
                           
                           <p>“The students who get to participate in this are really able to get a leg up on the
                              competition when joining the workforce,” Calhoun said. “For me, it brings together
                              everything I’m learning in the classroom and has taught me the intricacies of homebuilding
                              and developing a plan.”</p>
                           
                           <p>Irish Horsey, assistant professor of construction management and advisor to the NAHB
                              student chapter, said Calhoun’s commitment to the organization was integral to the
                              team’s success this past year.</p>
                           
                           <p>“Mac is a model student,” she said. “From spending long nights and weekends to prepare
                              the team for competition to hosting on campus events, his dedication was stellar.
                              Mac is on his way to being an exceptional leader having secured positions with leading
                              residential builders and exceeding employer expectations.”</p>

                              needs, interests and concerns within the construction industry.<br><img class="large img_left" id="" src="/constructionmanagement/images/news/2018-2019/04.23.19-agc-news2.jpg" alt="AGC KSU"><br>During the Fall 2018 – Spring 2019 school year, the AGC student chapter hosted 12
                              events. These events included presentations from leading construction industry professionals,
                              an office visit to JE Dunn Construction and Holder Construction, two volunteer events

                              and gave away an AGC of Georgia Young Leadership Program (YLP) membership to a KSU
                              student. There is no doubt the AGC student chapter has been active this school year!<br><br>The AGC KSU student chapter is also excited to announce that all three AGC scholarships

                           <p><em>Bennett Thrasher and Kennesaw State University release</em><br><em>annual survey results of the state’s privately-held construction companies</em></p>
                           
                           <p>February 27, 2019</p>
                           
                           <p>The third annual Georgia Construction Outlook Survey indicates that labor shortages
                              and reliability from sub-contractors continues to be a looming concern for 83 percent
                              of the state’s privately-held construction companies.</p>
                           
                           <p>The survey was conducted by Bennett Thrasher, one of the country’s largest full-service
                              public accounting and consulting firms, in collaboration with Kennesaw State University’s
                              Department of Construction Management. Designed to provide benchmarking data of the
                              state’s general contractors and subcontractors, the survey is led by Scott Hazy and
                              Tom Jollay, co-leaders of Bennett Thrasher’s Construction Practice, along with Khalid
                              Siddiqi, chair of Kennesaw State University’s Department of Construction Management.</p>
                           
                           <p>Results are based on responses from 149 Georgia-based privately-held construction
                              companies in categories including compensation, recruiting and retention strategies,
                              profitability, healthcare costs and benefits, innovation, business challenges and
                              project backlog.</p>
                           
                           <p>“The labor shortage has become increasingly acute over the last three years. It’s
                              no surprise that recruiting and retaining qualified individuals remains the top challenge
                              for the construction industry,” said Siddiqi. “However, it is encouraging to see that
                              the number of organizations focusing on innovation and technology continue to rise
                              as we address this significant issue.”</p>
                           
                           <p>“In our third year of this groundbreaking survey, the number of participating firms
                              continues to increase. We are excited to have significant benchmarking data available
                              to show the strength of the construction industry and address the challenges, technology
                              and best practices that are evolving within the industry,” added Hazy, co-leader of
                              Bennett Thrasher’s Construction Practice, along with Jollay.</p>

                              <li>The average salary increase was slightly lower than in the previous year, but companies

                           <p>On Thursday, January 31st, the <a href="https://www.aeecenter.org/membership/chapters/student-chapters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AEE</a> Kennesaw State University (KSU) Student Chapter hosted an event on electric vehicles
                              at the KSU Marietta Campus. Presenting was Dr. Richard A. Simmons, a Senior Research
                              Engineer and Mechanical Engineering Instructor at Georgia Tech Strategic Energy Institute.
                              Dr. Simmons’ presentation was called “Energy Use in EVs and Advanced Vehicles” and
                              he touched on his research regarding electric cars and automotive processes. Included
                              in his presentation were his ideas on sustainable development and meeting the planet’s
                              energy demands, while also discussing alternative fuels and intelligent systems, policy
                              standards in regard to fuel and renewable fuel, energy density and the functions of
                              turbo systems. Simmons also had one of his former Georgia Tech research students,
                              Chelsea Calhoun, present her research project titled, “Investigation and Optimization
                              of Multiple Performance Objectives Using Small Scale, Low-Cost, Remotely Controlled
                              Vehicles”. Calhoun was able to show attendees the amount of energy consumed at various
                              constant speeds (low, medium, fast) as well as speed changes that mocked an urban,
                              city-like environment, i.e. a “stop and go” environment.</p>

                              KSU students, KSU professors and AEE Atlanta, Georgia members. Due to the nature of

                              Management raised more than $167,000 for scholarships and the development of state-of-the-art

                           <p>The 17th Annual Industry Advisory Board Fundraiser Gala, held last week at the Cobb
                              Energy Performing Arts Centre, drew more than 72 sponsorships from individuals and
                              organizations.</p>
                           
                           <p>Funds raised this year eclipsed the previous high of $140,000 set in 2017. During
                              the event, construction management students were awarded $14,500 in scholarships.</p>
                           
                           <p>“We are so very grateful to see this level of support from our industry partners throughout
                              the region,” said Khalid Siddiqi, chair of Kennesaw State’s Department of Construction
                              Management. “Through their generosity, we are able to lessen the financial burden
                              of students who wish to receive a world-class education at KSU. I am thrilled to see
                              how much this event has grown since its inception.”</p>
                           
                           <p>The gala started from humble beginnings, raising just $7,000 in its first year. Its
                              recent success can be attributed in part to the department’s robust industry advisory
                              board, Siddiqi said.</p>
                           
                           <p>The board has 42 members – many of whom are donors – and its mission is to ensure
                              students meet the educational and career needs of the industry from an employer’s
                              perspective.</p>

                              Management, and Margaret Rauber, Vice President of Operations at Winter Construction,
                              addressed ABC of Georgia members on ways and means of tackling the issue from both
                              a theoretical and a practical perspective.</p>
                           
                           <p>Dr. Siddiqi shared the results of his research paper “Best Practices for Attracting
                              and Retaining Female Construction Project Managers”, which he co-authored along with
                              Kennesaw State MS CM Program Graduate, Casey Stockbridge and Tom Jollay of Bennett
                              and Thrasher.</p>
                           
                           <p>Their research showed the challenges of not just recruiting women into construction
                              management but retaining them. “Women leave the industry at a much higher rate than
                              men,” Siddiqi explained. “Our research revealed some of the reasons why.” Siddiqi
                              listed the top 5 key differences between men and women when it comes to views about
                              their employer. While some of these differences involved common tenets of company
                              policy, such as anti-sexual harassment policies and alternative work schedules, others
                              were more surprising (for instance, 82% of males but only 59% of females care about
                              a company vehicle.) Dr. Siddiqi shared some proven best practices for attracting and
                              retaining female project managers in construction industry organizations.</p>

                              Wind, visited KSU Marietta to discuss the added benefits that their mini-wind turbines
                              can offer as compared to large turbines on wind farms. These benefits included increased
                              renewable energy created in less space with lower wind speeds and the possibility
                              for wind walls to retract into ground bunkers during bad weather conditions to prevent
                              product damage. American Wind also discussed topics on magnetism and air turbulence,
                              and even demonstrated a MicroCube in action. Recently, American Wind, Inc was named

                           <p>The Student Chapter recently spoke to children in the program on five main sustainability
                              initiatives including, water usage, food, recycling, energy and power conservation
                              and solar power technology. They also led hands-on activities, including creating
                              a solar powered vehicle out of a recycled tin can, and presented a PowerPoint explaining
                              various sustainability concepts. <br><br>Student Chapter participants very much enjoyed having the opportunity to share information
                              regarding sustainability with the future generation and teach them that despite their

                           <p>Gunjan Garg and Adanegn Woldemichael accompanied Dr. Siddiqi, Chair of the Construction
                              Management Department KSU, to the <a href="https://ccaps.umn.edu/54th-annual-asc-international-conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">54th ASC Conference</a> in Minneapolis, MN. The Associated Schools of Construction Conference is the premier
                              conference for Construction Management discipline where national and international
                              peer-reviewed papers are presented. <br><br>Ms. Garg presented a paper entitled "EarthCraft Homes Costs more than Conventional
                              Homes". The objective of this study was to identify the construction cost differential
                              between EarthCraft and conventional homes, and included a comparison of projects completed
                              by the EarthCraft homebuilders and conventional builders. Mr. Woldemichael presented
                              a paper&nbsp;entitled&nbsp;"Unions Electrical Workers are not Against Prefabrication". The study
                              identified the best practices for prefabrication feasible for electrical workers who
                              are part of unions. <br><br>Dr. Siddiqi presented&nbsp;a paper&nbsp;entitled "Best Practices for Attracting and Retaining

                           <p>By Anastaciah Ondieki</p>
                           
                           <p>The last five years have been great for the construction industry with spending at
                              an all-time high of close to $1.3 trillion. The industry’s growth places a high demand
                              for a skilled workforce and further reveals a gap in the number of men and women working
                              in construction.</p>
                           
                           <p>According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, women represent only 9 percent of
                              the total labor force in the construction industry, traditionally viewed as a male
                              dominated field. Women working in the industry are concentrated mainly in the sales
                              and office sector with fewer occupying the professional and management sector. Representation
                              of women on the construction trades side is also low.</p>
                           
                           <p>Economist Andrew Flowers with Indeed Hiring Lab, a team of economists who provide
                              insights into the labor market said the difference in numbers could be a question
                              of whether women are interested in the field, or whether companies create a culture
                              of workplace balance that accommodates women.</p>
                           
                           <p>Flowers says the demand for workers could be an opportunity for women to explore the
                              thriving industry, because jobs posted are not being filled fast enough.</p>
                           
                           <p>“More women would be potentially drawn into the construction industry because of how
                              tight the labor market is,” said Flowers.</p>
                           
                           <p>Flowers says overall construction industry job postings on his team’s website are
                              at the highest point in six years.</p>
                           
                           <h4>Better Pay, shorter line</h4>
                           
                           <p>The gender gap for women in the construction field is mirrored by the enrollment rates
                              of female versus male students in technical colleges within the state. Data from the
                              Technical College System of Georgia shows that last year, only 836 of the 10,730 students
                              enrolled in construction related courses were female.</p>
                           
                           <p>The biggest problem, according to Professor Khalid Siddiqi, chair of the Construction
                              Management department at Kennesaw State University’s college of Architecture and Construction
                              Management, is the lack of exposure of the program at the high school level.</p>
                           
                           <p>“I feel really challenged that I cannot get the message to the schools where these
                              students are coming from,” Siddiqi said.</p>
                           
                           <p>The number is even worse for women because of age-old roles assigned to women.</p>
                           
                           <p>Last Fall, only 11.6 percent of 388 students enrolled at KSU to pursue a degree in
                              Construction management were female. Siddiqi however says the school has in the last
                              five years increased the number of women in the program by 1,000 and hopes to see
                              the numbers rising.</p>
                           
                           <p>With the growing demand for skilled labor, Siddiqi sees a big opportunity for female
                              students in the estimation and scheduling professions and the quick absorption of
                              graduating students into the work force.</p>
                           
                           <p>“None of our students have to look for a job…they get into full time employment because
                              they already have the skill sets needed to hit the ground running,”says Siddiqi of
                              the ready market for well trained industry workers.</p>
                           
                           <p>The construction jobs prospects in Atlanta and the state in general are reflective
                              of the booming construction industry nationwide.</p>
                           
                           <p>According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the city of Sandy Springs ranked
                              9th nationwide last year among metropolitan areas employing the highest number of
                              construction managers in the nation, with 4,690 jobs created at an average hourly
                              wage of $56.43.</p>
                           
                           <p>The state ranked fourth nationwide among highest paying jobs for construction managers
                              with the yearly wage at $113,930. The average hourly wage for a construction workers
                              as of last month was $29.43, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics.</p>
                           
                           <p>That, according to Siddiqi is indicative of growing prospects for those interested
                              in the construction management field.</p>
                           
                           <p>“I see a very strong possibility that females are going to be joining the construction
                              industry because of not only lucrative pay but the realization that the jobs they
                              prefer can make a difference in the city’s skylines,” said Siddiqi on the favorable
                              job prospects.</p>
                           
                           <p>Even in the wake of public outcry over gender pay discrepancies , jobs in the construction
                              field have the narrowest wage gap with women earning 95.7% of what men get, according
                              to the U.S. Department of Labor . This is much higher than the median gap of 20%.</p>
                           
                           <h4>Corporate efforts in closing the gap</h4>
                           
                           <p>Some construction companies and developers are involving themselves with ongoing efforts
                              to bring gender parity in the industry through strategic policies.</p>
                           
                           <p>Kevin Kuntz, President of the Southeast division of McCarthy Building Company Inc.,
                              which employs close to 2,000 people said his company is committed to diversifying
                              its workforce to give equal opportunities to all employees to rise through the ranks
                              based on performance regardless of their gender.</p>
                           
                           <p>“When you bring in people of diverse backgrounds, they bring in diverse perspectives
                              and with diverse perspectives comes very creative ideas and solutions” which Kuntz
                              says result in better services.</p>
                           
                           <p>According to company data, female employees accounted for 31.5 percent of the new
                              hires the company took in last year, with most of the jobs in project engineering.</p>
                           
                           <p>Women account for 24% of the total workforce for the company.</p>
                           
                           <p>As data points to continued growth, industry insiders hope that the face of the typical
                              construction worker also gets to evolve to allow women a chance to tap into the growth,
                              as well as, the lucrative salaries that accompany the profession.</p>
                           
                           <p>Daphne Bryson Jackson, the co-founder of the Women in Construction, Engineering and
                              Related Services (WICERS) says having more younger women introduced to STEM-related
                              courses will help boost the number of women in the field.</p>
                           
                           <p>“This kind of generation has women who are bold. They come in and go full throttle,”
                              adds Jackson.</p>
                           
                           <p>Olivia Fru, project manager for a $90 million active adult community being built in
                              Atlanta was not greeted by a growing economy or thriving construction industry when
                              she graduated in 2007 from Southern Polytechnic State University. At the time, there
                              were no jobs, and getting her foot into the door as a project engineer was “very difficult”.</p>
                           
                           <p>But she hit the ground running when she landed her first job, despite reservations
                              about her capabilities by one company president. She credits her start in the field
                              to a vote of confidence on her behalf by a company VP who gave her a chance to prove
                              her worth. Ten years later and close to 20 projects down, Olivia who is now managing
                              a multi-million-dollar project where she oversees over 70 sub-contractors, the project
                              schedule and finances says it has taken wits, hard work and ignoring some stereotypes
                              to find her footing in the industry.</p>
                           
                           <p>“Over the years I have let my abilities speak for me,” she says adding that she ensures
                              that those working around her judge her by her abilities rather than the fact that
                              she is a woman.</p>
                           
                           <p>She is aware of the gap between men and women in the field and hopes for parity in
                              numbers.</p>
                           
                           <p>“Even with undergrad, it was maybe 5 women in the program,” she said adding that she
                              has grown accustomed to working in a field where women are minorities.</p>
                           
                           <p>At 31, Fru does not fit the profile of your typical project manager with a general
                              contracting company.</p>
                           
                           <p>“You don’t see people my age doing this. Companies are really looking to hire,” she
                              said of current job market.</p>
                           
                           <p>Her sights are set growing her career to become the vice president of a construction
                              company some time in the near future. She sees no roadblock to her goals and hopes
                              to see more women join the lucrative career.</p>
                           
                           <p>“If more people get used to seeing people in these roles and even higher, then it
                              becomes normal…” Fru said.</p>

                              State University, says she became interested in construction at a young age. She says
                              she enjoyed watching structures go up while living in Cameroon. “It’s like playing
                              Lego,” says Olivia. ALYSSA POINTER/ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM</h6>

                           <p>By Arlinda Smith Broady</p>
                           
                           <p>Construction projects are cropping up all over metro Atlanta as it has emerged from
                              the Great Recession, but one challenge is filling the demand for workers.</p>
                           
                           <p>Industry leaders say there is a serious shortage of skilled workers, though local
                              high schools are partnering with businesses, technical colleges and four-year universities
                              to produce the necessary workforce.</p>
                           
                           <p>High schools throughout the state had already begun adding&nbsp;“pathways” to careers&nbsp;such
                              as construction jobs, as well as those that require post-secondary training and college
                              courses. According to the Construction Education Foundation of Georgia, the state’s
                              public schools have over 150 skilled-trade construction and metals programs with 17,000-plus
                              students enrolled.</p>
                           
                           <p>Educators have shifted in the past decade from the idea that everyone graduates from
                              high school and heads to college. “Our focus now is that everyone graduates with a
                              plan,” said Kelly Walter, assistant principal at Berkmar High School in Gwinnett County.
                              “Whether it’s a university, tech school or straight to work, we want students to have
                              an idea what they want to do when they leave here.”</p>
                           
                           <p>Research shows that not everyone is college material. And with the increased need
                              for skilled workers, state funding has been allocated to make sure everyone who wants
                              to learn a trade has the means to do it. A state initiative that went into effect
                              in January ensures that students who opt for high-demand careers can earn a decent
                              living without student loans or other educational debt. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
                              data show that most construction jobs in Georgia pay $30,000 to $75,000 annually.</p>
                           
                           <p>Berkmar has had an architectural and construction pathway for four years. With funding
                              from the state and county, the school turned the old in-school suspension area into
                              a wing for architecture, electrical, carpentry and masonry work. This year it will
                              graduate its first group to complete the cycle, who will be qualified to go straight
                              to work.</p>
                           
                           <p>“My main goal is to bring the construction work-site experience to the students and
                              bring the students to real-life construction companies,” said John Tronolone, construction
                              academy coach at Berkmar.</p>
                           
                           <p>It’s a traditionally male-dominated industry, so the opportunity to try it out before
                              graduation appealed to juniors Isis Crossley and April Rodriguez as well as senior
                              Kenia Gutierrez.</p>
                           
                           <p>“I kind of fell into this by accident and now I know this is what I want to do,” said
                              Crossley.</p>
                           
                           <p>Rodriguez has a brother in the construction field, and he urged her to give it a try.</p>
                           
                           <p>“He told me there are many opportunities for women in construction so I wanted to
                              see for myself.” she said.</p>
                           
                           <p>Gutierrez plans to attend Gwinnett Tech in the fall and wants to somehow incorporate
                              a construction career with cosmetology. She said she likes the fact that her options
                              are limitless.</p>
                           
                           <p>The academy partners with&nbsp;local businesses that donate money, materials and most importantly
                              time.</p>
                           
                           <p>“In order to be competitive in the real world, our students need to see what the real
                              world is like,” said Tronolone. “They can go through coursework, but seeing how those
                              skills they’re learning turn into real buildings makes a lot of difference.”</p>
                           
                           <p>In a survey of construction businesses by accounting firm Bennett Thrasher and the
                              construction management department at Kennesaw State University released in June,
                              87 percent of construction firms called the search for skilled workers their top problem.</p>
                           
                           <p>“The industry is definitely in need of more people,” said Ashton Watt, personnel and
                              recruiting manager at Eckardt Electric, a company that has more than 80 years in metro
                              Atlanta specializing in large-scale projects such as hospitals and universities. “When
                              I came on in 2011 we had about 70 employees. We just recently hired our 400th.”</p>
                           
                           <p>“We have deep roots in the area and we’re looking for ways to grow the next generation,”
                              said Watt. “A lot of students who want to try their hand at entry-level jobs have
                              lots of room for advancement.”</p>
                           
                           <p>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that in 2005 there were 11.5 million workers
                              in the construction industry, and the unemployment rate hovered around 8.2 percent.
                              That number dropped to 10.6 million in 2010, and unemployment jumped to 18 percent.
                              Even though&nbsp;employment has improved, the workforce has not rebounded to pre-recession
                              levels. In 2015, unemployment was 7.1 percent but the construction workforce contracted
                              further to 10.4 million, according to a report from BuildZoom, a site that focuses
                              on construction data.</p>
                           
                           <p>In Georgia, the construction industry needs about 15,000 new workers every year —
                              with half of those in metro Atlanta, according to the BLS.</p>
                           
                           <p>The industry may have an image problem. A recent survey of 18- to 25-year-olds from
                              the National Association of Home Builders revealed only 3 percent were interested
                              in construction as a career. Most surveyed wanted a less physically demanding job
                              and perceived construction as difficult.</p>
                           
                           <p>Scott Shelar, president of the Construction Education Foundation of Georgia, said
                              most young people have misconceptions of what the industry entails. “Construction
                              is more than a guy with a hammer,” said Shelar. “There is very sophisticated technology
                              in place. You can’t build something like the Mercedes Benz Stadium without highly
                              skilled and highly trained workers.”</p>
                           
                           <p>CEFGA recently sponsored its annual Career Expo, which links students and professionals
                              in construction, utilities, highways, electrical, mechanical, energy, mining and more.
                              The event also features the SkillsUSA State Championships, a competition that invites
                              students to showcase their skills in a number of construction-related disciplines.
                              Another highlight is a job fair with businesses willing to hire 16- and 17-year-olds
                              as well as recent grads. Several hundred students brought resumes and met with companies,
                              and virtually all received offers.</p>
                           
                           <p>According to analysis by Construction Industry Resources Inc., one of the most in-demand
                              construction jobs in Georgia is craft laborer. The current need in the state is 52,783
                              workers through August 2021. Laborers perform many basic tasks on construction sites
                              and mostly work full time. Although the pay is at the bottom of the range at about
                              $30,000, the job has some of the most potential for advancement. Training is available
                              through technical schools, community colleges, registered apprenticeship programs
                              and industry training programs.</p>
                           
                           <p>Filling the need for skilled laborers takes a group effort, said Mike Dunham, CEO
                              of Associated General Contractors of Georgia Inc.</p>
                           
                           <p>“Nothing can get done without the construction industry,” he said. “You need to build
                              the facilities for new business, expand existing businesses, maintain aging buildings
                              — construction is linchpin for growing new business and maintaining existing business.”</p>
                           
                           <p>Dunham pointed out that there aren’t enough skilled workers to replace those retiring.
                              “For every 4.5 people who retire in the construction industry, there’s just one person
                              taking their place,” he said. “After a while, you don’t have anyone left.”</p>
                           
                           <p>Dunham said there are state initiatives to turn those numbers around.</p>
                           
                           <p>To encourage employers to bring younger workers into the field, HB 402 was passed
                              in the 2015-2016 legislative session. It allowed companies a reduction in insurance
                              costs so students 16 or older who are enrolled in work-based program at an accredited
                              school can work for them. This allowed construction companies especially to employee
                              youngsters and get them started in a real-world environment.</p>
                           
                           <p>The Hope Career Grant was expanded in January to offer students greater career opportunities
                              in five of Georgia’s fast-growing industries, increasing the number of programs that
                              qualify for this grant to 17. Majors in the construction field the grant will now
                              cover include air conditioning technology, carpentry, construction management, electrical
                              construction and maintenance, masonry and plumbing.</p>
                           
                           <p>Industries covered by the HOPE Career Grant were identified by Governor Deal’s High-Demand
                              Career Initiative as strategically important to the state’s economic growth. The grant
                              is among the many forms of financial assistance available through the Georgia Student
                              Finance Commission.</p>
                           
                           <p>And it’s never too late. There is no age limit to be eligible for the grant.</p>

                           <p>Dr. Khalid Siddiqi, Chair of Kennesaw State University’s Department of Construction
                              Management, shared a presentation for the Construction Management program with 80
                              CEOs and CFOs from premier construction firms in Georgia. The Lunch and Learn Session
                              was held on January 30, 2018 at Maggianos, Cumberland Mall. <br><br>He presented recruiting options and strategies that require a commitment at the corporate
                              level of the organization and forming relationships with universities.</p>
                           
                           <p>“The most important area that continues to stand out in both the 2016 and 2017 survey
                              outcomes is recruiting and retention strategies used by organizations. It’s the human
                              capital which is linked to profitability, compensation and technology."<br><br>Dr. Siddiqi further stated, “Most organizations at present would not consider approaching
                              a client acquisition strategy without a clear value proposition, segmentation, profitable
                              fee structure, collateral, sales approach and brand. Yet, when it comes to talent
                              acquisition, we tend to abandon strategy and focus on the immediate need and/or technical
                              resumes.”<br><br>According to Dr. Siddiqi, acquiring and retaining talent is actually no different
                              from acquiring and retaining clients. You need to develop a strategy, filter through
                              an unwavering culture, and execute with a strong marketing approach.<br><br>This presentation was previously made before a national audience (ACCE IAB Best Practices)
                              for a workshop in Orlando, Florida in February 2017. Dr. Siddiqi cited co-presenters
                              Rodney Smith, President of Parrish Construction, and Paul Hogan, President of Hogan
                              Construction Group. He presented a strong marketing approach toward hiring and retention
                              of construction professionals. These two individuals have a corporate policy at their
                              organization level to acquire and retain talent. These are not the only organizations
                              with a corporate level commitment; there are some others who also have a well-defined
                              and articulated talent acquisition strategy. However, based on his personal experience
                              and interactions, he finds that most organizations do not have talent acquisition
                              as a core value and he highly recommends that they make a corporate development plan
                              for talent acquisition as a value proposition to attract and retain the best and the
                              brightest.<br><br>He also suggested a creation of “state of the art facilities” that can cater to the
                              strong demand for project managers and project engineers needed in various sectors
                              of the construction industry. These sectors include highway construction, electrical
                              and mechanical contractors engaged in all types of building, developers, general contractors,
                              facility managers and homebuilders.<br><br>Recently, 154 construction companies responded to an online survey. The results were
                              presented by Scott Hazy and Tom Jollay, Bennett Thrasher’s Construction Practice co-leaders,
                              along with a corporate development update by Dr. Khalid Siddiqi. The purpose of gathering
                              this info was to provide specific bench marking data of the state of Georgia’s general
                              contractors and subcontractors. The number of participants were nearly doubled from
                              the previous year’s study. Georgia is home to 9,600 privately held construction companies.</p>

                           <p>As a child, Chase West meandered down the halls of the former Southern College of
                              Technology with his father, Eddie, chatting with professors and admiring the numerous
                              awards that lined the brick walls as they walked.</p>
                           
                           <p>At the time, Eddie West wanted to show his son the place where he learned his craft,
                              long before becoming an electrical contractor and starting A. West Enterprise in Albany,
                              Ga., with his wife, Angie. He never anticipated that his son would follow him and
                              his father-in-law to become a third-generation contractor. After graduating this month
                              with a degree in&nbsp;construction management, Chase West will join his father’s company
                              as a project manager.</p>
                           
                           <p>“If his granddaddy was alive, he would be so excited and so proud to see his work
                              continue on,” said Eddie West, a 1994 graduate of Southern Tech, now Kennesaw State
                              University.</p>
                           
                           <p>However, the path to graduation was somewhat of a journey, Chase West said. After
                              graduating high school, he enrolled in Darton State College, now Albany State University,
                              and later took a break from school to try his hand at law enforcement. He joined the
                              Albany Police Department in 2013 after completing the police academy.</p>
                           
                           <p>“I started policing because I wanted to be sure that construction was something I
                              wanted to do and not just something my dad wanted me to do,” West said.</p>
                           
                           <p>After a three-year stint as a patrolman, West began to reflect on the times his father
                              brought him into the construction management capstone room to show the work of students
                              who would soon graduate and “make some real money.” He decided it was time to put
                              down the badge and return to the place that gave his father a fresh start.</p>
                           
                           <p>“My dad has always taken me up to this campus year after year and made me walk these
                              halls, made me look at the plaques on the walls,” West said. “He was very proud of
                              the education he received. When I finally made it back up here myself, the first thing
                              I wanted to do was chase his legend down.”</p>
                           
                           <p>Carrying over credits he earned at Darton State, West completed his degree in just
                              two years, averaging about 15 credit hours per semester. Like his father, he served
                              as the student chapter president for the Association of General Contractors and was
                              named chairman for the University’s Construction Guild. He was active in the student
                              government association as a senator representing the College of Architecture and Construction
                              Management, and was initiated into the National Honor Society of Leadership and Success.</p>
                           
                           <p>“Chase has an impressive personality and is an avid listener. He stands firm on his
                              ground but also has a soft side, and is always ready and willing to help others,”
                              said Khalid Siddiqi, chair of KSU’s construction management department. “Several construction
                              companies approached me to recruit Chase, but he politely declined because he made
                              a commitment to his dad to work only after completing his degree program.”</p>
                           
                           <p>Though he had some field experience working alongside his father, West said he felt
                              being involved with the various student organizations gave him a new perspective on
                              project management. He credits the construction management faculty with continuing
                              to push him academically.</p>
                           
                           <p>“The professors are all extremely friendly and extremely helpful, and I’m not just
                              saying that,” West said. “They all know my name, and they’ve all gone out of their
                              way to help me any way that they can.”</p>
                           
                           <p>Eddie West jokes that his son couldn’t graduate fast enough, as construction managers
                              are a need for his company and others across the country. According to the Associated
                              General Contractors of America, 48 percent of contractors nationwide say they have
                              trouble filling salaried project manager positions, which include construction managers.
                              In Georgia alone, more than half of survey respondents said project managers were
                              their greatest need.</p>
                           
                           <p>Speaking from his own experience, Eddie West said that his son should be well equipped
                              for the job on Day 1.</p>
                           
                           <p>“I know Chase is getting a quality education because it’s pretty much the same education
                              I received two decades ago,” he said. “It’s been a lot of fun to see him go through
                              school and to call me to talk about what he’s learning because I’ve done it all before.”</p>

                           <p>Frinzi's multitude of contributions over the past ten years to both the CM Department,
                              and University as a whole, have significantly impacted students in so many ways. Some
                              of these&nbsp;contributions include: arranging field trips to his projects for students,
                              providing guest lectures, providing many internship opportunities, offering permanent
                              job placements to graduates and&nbsp;creating an endowed scholarship. Last year, Frinzi
                              was awarded "Recruiter of the Year" by the Construction Management Department, as
                              Batson-Cook recruited the highest number of CM&nbsp;interns and graduates.</p>
                           
                           <p>In addition to his direct impact on the CM Department, Frinzi also played a key role

                           <h4>KSU's LEED Lab Challenge</h4>
                           
                           <p>In Georgia, the passage of House Bill 255 prohibits any publicly funded building to
                              pursue LEED performance ratings. Although the bill perhaps&nbsp;did not intend to impact
                              curriculum and teaching in public universities, the collateral damage undeniably includes
                              one of the most inventive and effective&nbsp;sustainable teaching programs in the nation,
                              the LEED Lab. Authored by USGBC, the LEED Lab engages students with dynamic, real-world,
                              learning&nbsp;opportunities based upon the LEED rating system.&nbsp;</p>
                           
                           <p>Luckily for KSU College of Architecture and Construction Management students, they
                              have the innovative&nbsp;and determined minds of professors Ed Akins&nbsp;(Architecture) and
                              Brandi Williams (Construction Management). Since Bill 255 prohibits seeking LEED certification
                              on the publicly funded KSU campus,&nbsp;professors Akins and Williams came up with the
                              brilliant idea of creating a LEED Lab for KSU students that would allow them to work
                              with a building off-campus. They reached out to Susan Kidd, Executive Director of
                              the Center for Sustainability at Agnes Scott College (ASC), a privately funded college
                              in&nbsp;Decatur, Georgia, to initiate a partnership that would allow KSU students the opportunity
                              to participate in LEED Lab at an alternative location.</p>
                           
                           <p>For additional information on the partnership and how it benefits both KSU and Agnes
                              Scott College, please refer to Professor Akins article<span>&nbsp;</span>here.</p>
                           
                           <h4>From a Student's Perspective&nbsp;</h4>
                           
                           <p>"As a student, the LEED Lab is such an enriching experience. After taking this course,
                              I have a clearer understanding of the certification process for LEED&nbsp;EBOM, and I am
                              also engaged in learning more about LEED and pursuing personal accreditation. Being
                              able to combine the requirements LEED establishes&nbsp;for each credit with the physical
                              and financial constraints of an existing building was very productive to apply what
                              we learned in the classroom in a real-life&nbsp;setting. I hope more and more students
                              have access to the LEED Lab, and that this opportunity can motivate them to explore
                              sustainable practices."</p>

                              attended the 2017 MCAA Great Futures Forum in Indianapolis September 28 - 30.</p>
                           
                           <p>The Forum was truly an incredible experience for the students, who were so thankful
                              for the opportunity to network with other students and professionals from all over
                              the country. They were also introduced to new technologies being utilized in the field
                              in relation to MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) specialties.&nbsp;</p>
                           
                           <p>The student group participated in a mini-competition, which gave them the opportunity
                              to put their skills and knowledge to the test as a team. While attending the Forum,
                              the team also participated in a career fair, visited the NCAA Museum and attended
                              serval lectures from professionals that gave the students an insight into what it
                              would be like to work for a mechanical contractor and learn about where the industry
                              and related technology is headed.</p>

                           <p>An annual fundraiser held to support Kennesaw State University’s construction management
                              department reached new heights this year by collecting more than $140,000 for scholarships
                              and the development of teaching facilities.</p>
                           
                           <p>The 16th&nbsp;Annual Industry Advisory Board Fundraiser Gala, held last week at the Cobb
                              Energy Performing Arts Centre, drew more than 50 sponsorships from individuals and
                              organizations. Funds raised this year were more than 19 percent higher than in 2016,
                              and are a far cry from the $7,000 raised at the inaugural gala in 2001. Five students
                              were each awarded $2,000 scholarships at this year’s event.</p>
                           
                           <p>“Prospective students and their parents are attracted to state-of-the-art teaching
                              facilities and scholarship opportunities, both of which are high on our list of priorities,”
                              said Khalid Siddiqi, chair of Kennesaw State’s&nbsp;Department of Construction Management.
                              “I am extremely proud to see the success of the 2017 gala, and I’m impressed to see
                              the growth of this event since inception.”</p>
                           
                           <p>The gala’s success can be attributed in part to the department’s robust industry advisory
                              board, Siddiqi said. The board has 42 members – many of whom were also donors for
                              the fundraising gala – and its mission is to ensure students meet the educational
                              and career needs of the industry from an employer’s perspective.</p>
                           
                           <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the average salary for construction managers
                              in 2016 was $89,300, with a bachelor’s degree being the most common entry-level education.
                              Employment is projected to grow by 5 percent from 2014 to 2024, the agency said.</p>
                           
                           <p>According to the Associated General Contractors of America, however, 48 percent of
                              contractors nationwide say they have trouble filling salaried project manager positions,
                              which include construction managers. In Georgia alone, more than half of respondents
                              said project managers were their greatest need.</p>
                           
                           <p>Kennesaw State’s program offers both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in construction
                              management, along with certificate programs in project management, land development,
                              special construction and facility management. Graduates maintain a near perfect job
                              placement rate, Siddiqi said.</p>

                           <p>July 28, 2017</p>
                           
                           <p>For Myles Cardenas, high school basketball meant everything to him and defined him
                              in many ways.</p>
                           
                           <p>“My social life had been built around basketball,” said Cardenas, who played four
                              years of varsity basketball in high school. “I had to recreate myself when I came
                              here.”</p>
                           
                           <p>Determined to make the most of his college experience when he arrived to campus in
                              2014, Cardenas, who graduated this summer with a bachelor’s degree in&nbsp;construction
                              management, embraced campus life. He joined student organizations, focused intently
                              on his studies and made time for a little intramural basketball.</p>
                           
                           <p>“My days used to be filled with school and basketball, and because I wasn’t playing
                              anymore, I knew that I could be working and doing other things,” he said.</p>
                           
                           <p>Cardenas made a conscious effort to bring the lessons he learned on the basketball
                              court to every aspect of his life, inside and outside the classroom. That strategy
                              earned him top honors from a national professional organization, recognition as Kennesaw
                              State’s Student of the Year, and employment with two prominent construction companies
                              while attending KSU.</p>
                           
                           <p>During his first year as a construction management major, Cardenas joined the&nbsp;National
                              Association of Home Builders of KSU, the student chapter of the national professional
                              organization.</p>
                           
                           <p>“I really blossomed with the NAHB chapter,” he said. “I started in 2014 as a presenting
                              member of the team at competition, then VP and finally, my senior year as president.”</p>
                           
                           <p>Cardenas led the 2017 KSU team to sweep the competition at the International Builder’s
                              Show, taking first in the nation for the&nbsp;NAHB Student Chapters Residential Construction
                              Management Competition&nbsp;for four-year programs.</p>
                           
                           <p>“The competition is a lot of work, but it is the most rewarding experience that I
                              have ever been a part of,” he said. Cardenas also was honored with NAHB’s Outstanding
                              Student Award.</p>
                           
                           <p>Being involved with teams has been a huge part of Cardenas’ success. He served as

                           <p>This spring, the Division of Student Affairs named Cardenas as&nbsp;Student of the Year.&nbsp;</p>
                           
                           <p>“Myles Cardenas is an exceptional KSU student and contributes in a variety of ways
                              to improve campus life for his fellow students,” said Kathy Alday, assistant vice
                              president for student affairs.</p>
                           
                           <p>Before coming to Kennesaw State, Cardenas attended a small private college in Kansas
                              to follow his dream of playing college basketball. After a demanding athletic schedule
                              and rarely seeing his family, Cardenas returned to his hometown of Conyers, Georgia
                              at the end of his first year.</p>
                           
                           <p>His family, in anticipation of their son’s return, scouted out the best school in
                              the state for him to study architecture and discovered the former Southern Polytechnic
                              State University.</p>
                           
                           <p>“Even as a young kid, I was always interested in the designs of buildings,” Cardenas
                              said, who came to the Marietta Campus in Fall 2014. “Architecture is where I thought
                              I wanted to be.”</p>
                           
                           <p>Cardenas had attended a vocational high school for two years to focus on architecture
                              and construction trades. On advice from mentors and former teachers, Cardenas explored
                              KSU’s construction management program and ways to build his experience in the field.</p>
                           
                           <p>An ambitious student, he attended the university’s career fair his first semester
                              and soon landed a position with&nbsp;Batson-Cook Construction, a Southeast general contractor,
                              where he worked for nearly two years.</p>
                           
                           <p>“What I admire most about Myles is his persistence and ability to rebound,” said Khalid
                              Siddiqi, chair of the construction management program. “Myles was a part of KSU NAHB
                              team that placed 23rd&nbsp;in 2014, 10th&nbsp;in 2015 and first in 2016. That says a lot about
                              his character and resilience, which coupled with his humility makes him a favorite.”</p>
                           
                           <p>While attending national NAHB competitions, professionals and organizations looking
                              to hire sought out top students like Cardenas. After interviewing with a national
                              home builder at the national competition in early 2016, Cardenas accepted an internship
                              in land development, his academic concentration within the University’s construction
                              management program.</p>
                           
                           <p>“I’ve been able to see the industry from a different vantage point in this internship,”
                              said Cardenas, who has worked for&nbsp;CalAtlantic Homes&nbsp;in Atlanta for the past year.
                              “It’s great having people who want me to shadow them so that I can learn as much as
                              I can.”</p>
                           
                           <p>What hooked Cardenas on construction management initially was the collaborative, team
                              effort involved in the field, he explained.</p>
                           
                           <p>“Construction Management is about managing the building process,” he said. “We aren’t
                              necessarily builders, nor do we tell the architects how to design, but we do ensure
                              that the facility is structurally sound and we manage how to do that.</p>
                           
                           <p>“It’s estimating and project management and controlling the project from start to
                              finish. We work together with architects and engineers as one big team.&nbsp;</p>
                           
                           <p>“For me, it all goes back to basketball. I loved being on a team and that team mentality
                              is what made me choose construction management in the first place,” he said.</p>

                           <p>May 31, 2017</p>
                           
                           <p>When a massive fire caused the collapse of an Interstate 85 bridge in Atlanta on March
                              30, Jeff Shropshire (Civil Engineering Technology, ’90) dropped what he was doing
                              and headed into the office.</p>
                           
                           <p>The senior vice president at <a href="http://cwmatthews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C.W. Matthews Contracting Company</a>, the state’s largest road construction contractor, knew his company’s expertise may
                              be needed. Within hours, the Georgia Department of Transportation had reached out
                              to them, and soon after, C.W. Matthews’ crews were on site.</p>
                           
                           <p>“Our major projects division crews were working on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_85_bridge_collapse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I-85</a> express toll lanes nearby when the I-85 bridge fell, so we were able to get our crews
                              out there quickly,” Shropshire said. Relocating crews proved beneficial as traffic
                              needed to be rerouted with the interstate’s closure.</p>
                           
                           <p>Shropshire was responsible for coordinating the efforts with <a href="http://www.dot.ga.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDOT</a>, and began immediately working on logistics and figuring out construction costs.
                              In his role, he monitored the overall project.</p>
                           
                           <p>“On the front-end, logistics was a big part of it. We quickly moved in traffic control
                              equipment,” said Shropshire, who has been with C.W. Matthews for nearly 29 years.
                              “And once we figured out construction costs, we were able to step back and let the
                              bridge crew do their job.”</p>
                           
                           <p>More than 640 feet of the I-85 bridges, including the 100-foot long burned-out section,
                              was replaced in six weeks, months ahead of schedule. It re-opened to traffic in both
                              directions on May 13.</p>
                           
                           <p>“Everything that we wanted to do went well with the subcontractors and suppliers,”
                              he said, adding there were no project setbacks. “Suppliers had the bridge beams casted
                              by day four. The timing worked out perfectly.”</p>
                           
                           <p>I-85 bridge</p>
                           
                           <p>Eleven crews worked around the clock – six crews during the day and five at night
                              – during the six-week project. Shropshire oversaw two key division managers, one a
                              day supervisor and one a night supervisor, in monitoring the 24/7 construction.</p>
                           
                           <p>“It was an all-hands-on-deck project, and even if nothing was going on, you wanted
                              to be there and be a part of it,” Shropshire said. “Building the bridge was just standard
                              construction, using the same means and methods that we normally use for all of our
                              projects.”</p>
                           
                           <p>However, impeccable timing, high-tech materials and good weather landed them ahead
                              of schedule. C.W. Matthews has 26 bridge crews, but could handpick crews from other
                              construction projects that were ahead of schedule or nearly complete.</p>
                           
                           <p>The $16.5 million I-85 bridge repair spanned six sections, and the company was able
                              to stage the project so that crews worked in a stair-step fashion. As soon as columns
                              were installed on a bent, the crews were able to cap it and move on in sequential
                              order to complete each section of the bridge, Shropshire explained.</p>
                           
                           <p>The concrete mix was also a project timesaver, he said. Instead of the standard concrete
                              mix used in road construction, which takes about 14 days to dry and set up, a more
                              advanced concrete sped dry time to about three days.</p>
                           
                           <p>As crews rebuilt the bridge, which carries nearly a quarter million vehicles each
                              day, GDOT’s Traffic Management Center gathered data on traffic flow. The C.W. Matthews
                              company was able to make traffic adjustments overnight.</p>
                           
                           <p>“In one case, we had the task of changing turn lanes, from one to two lanes, based
                              on the traffic data studies,” said Shropshire. “We shut down sections of the road
                              overnight, restriped it, and had traffic moving again by the next morning.”</p>
                           
                           <p>Shropshire landed a co-op with C.W. Matthews in college and joined the company full-time
                              after graduating. He earned a degree in civil engineering technology with a construction
                              option in 1990 from then Southern College of Technology (which was renamed Southern
                              Polytechnic State in 1996 and then consolidated with Kennesaw State in 2015).</p>
                           
                           <p>Shropshire has remained connected to the university and currently serves on Kennesaw
                              State’s Industry Advisory Board for Construction Management and chairs the resource
                              mobilization committee. Last year, he organized the department’s annual fundraising
                              gala, helping to raise nearly $120,000 for the department’s programs, student scholarships
                              and student competition teams. He will chair the annual gala again this year.</p>
                           
                           <p>In the days and weeks that followed the bridge collapse, Shropshire said that all
                              normal business was pushed to a later date, and life as he knew it, including his
                              volunteer involvement with KSU, was temporarily put on hold.</p>
                           
                           <p>While he was excited to work on a project of such magnitude and has enjoyed the success
                              of the I-85 bridge reconstruction project, he’s happy to get back to normal.</p>
                           
                           <p>“Any project that is this high profile, the energy levels are so high,” Shropshire
                              said, adding that the company completed an airport runway project in 33 days. “We
                              run at 90 miles per hour and then it all just stops when the project is finished.
                              Those energy levels are gone and we just go back to our everyday normal operations.”</p>

                              traveled to Orlando to present a 100-page project management proposal for a 32-acre
                              residential development in Decatur.<br>&nbsp;<br>“They give us a real life project, and we have to go through the process of buying
                              the land, building the project and show how we’re going to do it financially,” said
                              Cardenas, the chapter’s president.</p>
                           
                           <p>The KSU team’s proposal included building 349 townhomes on the tract of land in order
                              to maximize the development’s financial return on investment, said Cardenas.</p>
                           
                           <p>Teams across the country including Pennsylvania State University and California Polytechnic
                              State University vied for the top proposal for the Decatur development, which included
                              product and site design, project schedule and estimates, financial analysis and sales
                              and marketing strategies.</p>
                           
                           <p>KSU’s victory also came with a $60,000 grant to be paid over three years for the construction
                              management department. The money will help the department develop a residential construction
                              track and to increase student internship opportunities, said Charner Rodgers, team
                              adviser and KSU construction management professor.</p>
                           
                           <p>The chapter already has a partnership with Greater Atlanta Home Builders Association
                              that provides internship and mentoring opportunities for the students, said Cardenas,
                              who works as an intern at CalAtlantic Homes — a housing development company.</p>
                           
                           <p>KSU’s chapter was also recognized as an outstanding student chapter for the second
                              consecutive year for its membership, networking events and community service, Cardenas
                              said.</p>
                           
                           <p>This year’s contest marked the KSU chapter’s third year in competition and KSU’s first
                              year on top. The team placed 23rd in 2014 and 10th in 2015.</p>
                           
                           <p>KSU’s chapter includes about 35 students with a variety of majors, including construction
                              management, engineering, marketing, architecture and mechatronics.</p>
                           
                           <p>“It’s way more than just building homes, that’s why we try to diversify our team and
                              our chapter,” Cardenas, who also received the outstanding student award for the KSU

                              the competition at the International Builders’ Show in Orlando&nbsp;earlier this month.
                              The team placed first in the nation at the&nbsp;NAHB Student Chapters Residential Construction
                              Management Competition for four-year programs.</p>
                           
                           <p>The annual competition attracted more than 1,000 students, composing 60 teams, who
                              each completed a management proposal encompassing residential product components.
                              The proposals typically involve all aspects of residential construction management,
                              including market analysis, product and site design, project schedule and estimates,
                              financial analysis, green building initiatives, project management overview, and sales
                              and marketing strategies.</p>
                           
                           <p>“The competition is a lot of work, but it is the most rewarding experience that I
                              have ever been a part of,” said Myles Cardenas, KSU chapter president, who also received
                              the NAHB’s Outstanding Student Award this year. “I am extremely proud of every single
                              person who has been involved in the chapter over the years, and those who have graduated
                              from the university and still dedicate time to come back and help the chapter in any
                              way that they could.”</p>
                           
                           <p>Now in his third year of competition, Cardenas led the six-member KSU team (along
                              with three non-presenting members), creating a 100-page business proposal and presenting
                              their work to residential construction company executives who served as judges during
                              the three-day competition. &nbsp;</p>

                              Construction Management Department with $60,000 over three years. The grant will help
                              to further programs of study in residential construction, provide the tools and skill
                              sets needed by graduates to prepare for the future, and increase the number of qualified
                              college graduates entering the residential construction industry.</p>
                           
                           <p>“The team was definitely making waves at this competition,” said Rodgers, assistant
                              professor of construction management. Rodgers advises KSU’s team alongside Williams,
                              also an assistant professor.</p>

                              in 2015 and placed 23rd. Last year, the team took 10th place.</p>
                           
                           <p>The team was also recognized as the 2017 NAHB Outstanding Student Chapter for the

                                 builders associations. KSU’s chapter was chosen from more than 150 student chapters

                                 chair of the Construction Management department at Kennesaw State. “When students
                                 graduate, these budding professional construction managers hit the ground running,

                                 Competition. &nbsp;The KSU team’s proposal consisted of designing and building the mechanical

                                 project management and maintenance programs.&nbsp;</span></p>

                                 Competition, a hallmark competition that promotes construction management. &nbsp;The team,
                                 which prepared a proposal for the Fort Collins Museum of Discovery in Colorado, was
                                 among 23 universities competing.</span></p>

                                 projects, combined with&nbsp;strong industry support, provide vast laboratory opportunities

                                 careers in construction management. The competition is sponsored in part by the Trimmer
                                 Construction Education Foundation (TCEF) and ABC members. In addition to providing
                                 a significant learning opportunity, the competition fosters an environment that will
                                 bring out the best in each team; encourage dialogue among the students; and foster
                                 the team spirit as students rise to meet this challenge. The CMC is designed to challenge
                                 construction knowledge, time management, organizational, and presentation skills.
                                 The competition features teams of four (4) college and university students testing
                                 their project management, estimating, safety, quality control, and presentation skills.
